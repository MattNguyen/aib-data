## About our application process:
Qualified candidates can expect to go through a 4 step interview process. The first interview will be a call with Jess to assess cultural fit and to make sure our goals are aligned.

If we think there is a good fit, you'll have a call with one of our project managers to learn more about your skills and attitudes toward teamwork. If it's clear that you'd be a good addition to the team, we’ll ask you to complete a technical task for which you will be compensated.

If your technical task displays a high level of quality and care we will set up a final interview with our CEO or CTO.

The process can take up to 3 weeks.

Thank you kindly.
