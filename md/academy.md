# Cosmos Academy

## Meetups

COMING SOON! We will host regular [evening meetups in San Francisco](https://www.meetup.com/Cosmos_SF/) for developers who are interested in learning about developing for Cosmos. The Academy meetups will be from 6PM - 7PM on week nights. Dinner is on us!

Developers of all levels of familiarity with blockchain engineering are welcome, as engineers will get the most value out of these events. Interested people can join to learn about architecting the next decentralized application on top of the Cosmos Network.

#### Monday
Introduction to Tendermint, the Proof-of-Stake consensus engine which powers Cosmos.

#### Tuesday
Introduction to Ethermint, the high performance Proof-of-Stake implementation of Ethereum.

#### Wednesday
Introduction to Cosmos SDK, the batteries-included platform for building your blockchain.

#### Thursday
Introduction to Cosmos IBC, the communication interface that lets you exchange tokens through the Cosmos Hub.

## Resources

COMING SOON! A series of educational videos for developers interested in developing on Cosmos. Follow [@cosmos](https://twitter.com/cosmos) to get the latest releases. If you have topics that you think could use an explainer video, please talk to us on [Developer Chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#cosmos:matrix.org). Here are some of the upcoming topics.

#### Validator Program: An Introduction
Learn about running and securing a validator for the Cosmos Hub.

#### Cosmos Academy: An Introduction
An overview of what you can learn in the Cosmos Academy.
