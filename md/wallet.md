# Wallet Design

## /wallet -

* describes how to run a gaia full-node
* describes the HTTP/RPC endpoints exposed by that node
* walks through Cosmos Voyager and explains which endpoints our wallet uses and why
* explains that a light-node exposes the same HTTP/RPC endpoints

## goal -

* other wallet teams understand how to easily build on top of the exposed endpoints
* mobile app developers use the light-node to build wallet software for the hub
